4. High-Value Quotation Visibility (MD Oversight Logic)
Overview
A High-Value Quotation is automatically flagged by the system when a quotation exceeds defined financial or policy thresholds — but it is not blocked or delayed.
Agents can generate the PDF instantly; the MD simply sees it flagged in their dashboard for awareness.
________________________________________
Purpose
•	Allow field agents to operate freely and instantly.
•	Give MD full visibility into high-value deals.
•	Maintain flexibility to turn on approvals in the future (optional setting).
